## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and plays a vital role in various applications. This repository is a demonstration of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python, showcasing their differences in time complexity and performance.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in both iterative and recursive forms:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the left sublist of sorted elements and the right sublist of unsorted elements.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the input array around the pivot.

## Installation

To use the sorting algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dappa88/sorting-algos.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sorting-algorithms-python
```

3. You are now ready to explore the various sorting algorithms implemented in Python.

## Usage

To utilize the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Open the Python files corresponding to the sorting algorithm you wish to use.

2. Review the iterative and recursive implementations provided.

3. Customize the input data or load your dataset to observe the sorting algorithms in action.

4. Run the Python script to execute the sorting algorithm:

```bash
python bubble_sort.py
```

Replace `bubble_sort.py` with the filename of the specific sorting algorithm you want to run.
